\section*{Part-1 Introduction}

\subsection*{1.1 main advantage of multiprogramming}

It \textbf{improves utilization of CPU} and other hardware resources by keeping serval processes 
    in memory simultaneously instead of just one. When the current process needs to wait for
    some tasks, the CPU switch to the next process and so on.

\subsection*{1.2}
Define the essential properties of the following types of operating systems:
\begin{enumerate}[a.]
    \item Batch
    \item Time sharing
    \item Real time
    \item Network
    \item Distributed
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{1.3}
下面哪些指令是特权指令？

   A．设置定时器的值   B. 读时钟
   C. 清除内存        D 关闭中断
   E．从用户模式切换到监督模式

\section*{Part-2 OS structures}
   
\subsection*{2.1}
What is the purpose of system calls?

\subsection*{2.2}
What is the main advantage of the layered approach to system design?

\subsection*{2.3}
What is the main advantage of the microkernel approach to system design?
   

\section*{Other things}

\LaTeX \space code refer to these things and was complied on texlive2020.
\begin{itemize}
    \item  UCB-CS70's given homework template 
    \item  \href{https://www.latexlive.com}{A free website useful to edit \LaTeX \space formula code.}
\end{itemize}

The purpose of writing in English is to adapt to bilingual teaching and to improve my poor English 
writing skills in preparation for a possible future exchange program. 

Thanks for your correcting and grading :).
